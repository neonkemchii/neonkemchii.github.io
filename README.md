UPDATES ARE COMING SOON!
Yup, I'm making this an acutal game that anyone can play on any device with some unique game mechanics that can add more opportunities for modders to mess around with.

These changes include:
* New items and cosmetics that can only be unlocked by actually playing the game.
* An attempt at making a GUI and a new mode in the form of "Infinite" with randomly generated levels.
* Yes, this means mobile support will be added by making touch buttons that can be modified.
* More ideas are being thought out and experimented.
